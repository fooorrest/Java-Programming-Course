        <h1>Christianity</h1>
        <p><img src="sermon.jpg" width="162" height="181" align="right" />The most basic part of Christianity is the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and Messiah (Christ).</p>
        <p>Christians believe that, as the Messiah, Jesus was anointed by God as ruler and savior of all people. Christians also believe that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. The Christian belief of the Messiah is much different than the contemporary Jewish concept.</p>
        <p>The main Christian belief is that, through the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humans can be reconciled to God. Though this, they believe they are given salvation and the promise of eternal life.</p>
